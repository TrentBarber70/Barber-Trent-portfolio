I started to create a code that would turn on a light and print "67" whenever the button was pressed.
 Afterwards, I created a small circuit with a bread board, a microswitch, a blue gumdrop LED, and a Raspberry Pi pico to test
 how to have the serial monitor add values and have the LED to show reactivity so the player can see both the score go up and the light flash. However the flash from the LED was too fast and would repeatidly light on and off as the button was beign pressed. To fix the issue I added a delay of 10.

![10/8/25]
today I created a solenoid from a 3d printed spool and 36 gauge wire and a steel bolt however I can not tell if the solenoid is working. I only used a 9 volt battery and I can't tell if the electromagnet is working but the coils are heating up.

![What I've been up to]

Over the first few weeks of school I have been working on the conceptual parts for my project. I used the first week of school to program a scorer that would add 100 points each time the button was pressed. Then I created a circuit with 3 buttons and each button added a different value such as 100 or 200. Then I began to create a circuit on KICad but stopped because then we started to learn Git. After the Git week was over I began to learn about solenoids and how I could DIY one. I began to create a spool in fusion to make a practice solenoid but had no way to keep the 36 gauge copper wire tightly wound to the spool. I then modified the file to have two holes to hold the wire in place. Then when I finished the second solenoid I tested it with a 9v battery and I found that it would barely pull to the steel bolt I had for testing but the coil was getting hot which showed me that it was working. I then began to research the meaning of gauge and better ways to wrap the spool. Then this week I began by creating a launcher for the pinball machine and created a large launcher but needed springs. I ordered them today and I will finish the launcher on Tuesday or Wednesday. After that I will learn how to control neopixels and then finish the month by creating my first draft playfield.
